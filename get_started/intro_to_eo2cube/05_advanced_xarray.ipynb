    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python library `xarray` simplifies working with labelled multi-dimension arrays. The library introduces labels in the forms of dimensions, coordinates and attributes on top of `numpy` arrays. This structure allows easier and more effective handling of remote sensing raster data in a Python environment. Therefore, it is essential to fully understand the structure of an `xarray`. A first introduction into the usage of `xarray` within the eo2cube environment was given in [\"04_loading_data_and_basic_xarray\"](04_loading_data_and_basic_xarray.ipynb). This notebook builds on this gained knowledge and attempts to give a deeper understanding of the `xarray` data structure of raster data. Since the `xarray.Dataset` within the datacube environment is specialised for the use of remote sensing raster data, it differs slightly from the original `xarray` library. However, if you are interested in learning more about the basic structures of the original `xarray`, have a look at this [**\"introduction to xarray\" notebook**](intro_to_xarray.ipynb) within the \"intro_to_python\" directory.\n",

    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces users to the `xarray` library within the datacube environment. It aims to deepen the understanding of the `xarray` structure as a container for remote sensing raster data. Also it introduces useful `xarray` functions to effectivly work with raster data in the eo2cube environment. Within this notebook the following topics are covered:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Definition of the `xarray.Dataset` structure for eo2cube remote sensing data\n",
    "* Access of `xarray.Dataset` dimensions, measurements and metadata\n",
    "* Indexing and slicing of `xarray.Dataset`\n",
